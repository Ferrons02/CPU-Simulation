The model of the CPU is inside the .circ file, that I suggest you to open with Logisim 2.7.1; you then have to right click on the RAM module (the one close to the ALU), "Load Image", 
and finally load the Prime Factors program. Then go to simulate and enable the ticks, where you can also adjust the clock frequency.

Disclaimer:
I kept the whole project as it was when I firstly made it, so the Decoding Tables are in Italian and unfortunately I can no longer find the Instruction Set. Additionally I am aware 
that most of the solutions I adopted are certainly not optimal or completely wrong, however this has been a very insightful project for me at the time and I am proud of it to this day.
